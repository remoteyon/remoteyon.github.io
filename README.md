# git.remoteyon.com:

## This project involves porting my website completely to GitHub

Feel free to inspect the code in case you need something similar for your projects.



### Objectives:

1. Complete independence from WYSIWYG editors
2. Ability to quickly port my website to a different service
3. Use AI for complex CSS and JS code



### Reasons:

1. Privacy concerns
2. Safety concerns
3. Security concerns



### Tools:

* Current version built with Google's Gemini AI
* Previous version built with Microsoft's Copilot



### AI considerations:

* Using Canvas mode allows for versioning, but it's buggy, so always copy and paste the latest working code into an editor
* AI will make unwanted changes to other parts of the site: Check your prompt and preview the entire website to be sure
