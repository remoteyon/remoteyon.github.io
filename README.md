## This project involves porting my website completely to GitHub

Feel free to inspect the code in case you need something similar for your projects.



### Objectives:

1. Complete independence from WYSIWYG editors
2. Ability to quickly port my website to a different service
3. Use AI for complex CSS and JS code



### Reasons:

1. Privacy concerns
2. Safety concerns
3. Security concerns



### Tools:

* Current version built with Perplexity AI
* Previous Version built with Google's Gemini AI
* Previous version built with Microsoft's Copilot



### AI considerations:

* Unlike Gemini, Perplexity behaved badly only after many prompts. Restarting with a fresh prompt and a recent copy of the html file worked much better than in Gemini
* Using Canvas mode in Gemini allows for versioning, but it's buggy, so always copy and paste the latest working code into an editor
* Gemini will make unwanted changes to other parts of the site: Check your prompt and preview the entire website to be sure
* Gemini had a problem with a bigger and more detailes website generator prompt. It also suggested that I generate the files in multiple steps instead of one giant prompt.
* Deepseek will add chinese comments to the file, although all my instructions were in English! It will also slow down the browser to a halt while it (slowly) generates the code, way slower than other AIs
