## This project involves porting my website completely to GitHub

Feel free to inspect the code in case you need something similar for your projects.



### Objectives

1. Divest/Boycott from Google Sites
2. Complete independence from WYSIWYG editors
3. Ability to quickly port my website to any different service by copying files
4. Use AI for complex CSS and JS code



### Reasons

1. Privacy concerns
2. Safety concerns
3. Security concerns
4. Ethical concerns



### Tools

* Current version built with Perplexity AI
* Previous Version built with Google's Gemini AI
* Previous version built with Microsoft's Copilot



### AI considerations

* Now using one giant prompt to generate a fresh website every time, in case the AI starts messing up the code. Considering moving to modular prompt files.

### My experiences with different AIs



#### Perplexity

* Unlike Gemini, Perplexity behaved badly only after many prompts. Restarting with a fresh prompt and a recent copy of the html file worked much better than in Gemini.



#### Gemini

* Using Canvas mode in Gemini allows for versioning, but it's buggy, so always copy and paste the latest working code into an editor
* Gemini will make unwanted changes to other parts of the site: Check your prompt and preview the entire website to be sure
* Gemini had a problem with a bigger and more detailes website generator prompt. It also suggested that I generate the files in multiple steps instead of one giant prompt.



#### Abandoned



##### Deep Seek

* Deepseek will add chinese comments to the files, although all my instructions were in English! It will also slow down the browser to a halt while it (slowly) generates the code, way slower than other AIs.



##### Replit

* Although I specifically wanted a static page, replit went ahead and created a super-complicated one anyway. Not nice!
